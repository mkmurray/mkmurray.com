<p>If you've ever kicked off a way long build on accident in Visual Studio, I'm sure you've considered doing an <font face="Courier New">End Task</font> on it (or perhaps something far more drastic and rash).&#160; Well, there is a keyboard shortcut that will cancel the current build in progress.&#160; Just hit <font face="Courier New">Ctrl+Break</font>, and hand me the sledgehammer before you do something you regret.&#160; Computers are your friend.&#160; Repeat after me...</p>  </div>
