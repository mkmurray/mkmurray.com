<p></p>  <p>So I won't stray from programming entries very often on this blog unless there is something really important I feel needs to be said.</p>  <p>I, for one, am tired of the Michael Moore documentaries that do nothing but complain about how crappy our nation is.&#160; I also am not a fan of Al Gore's biased misrepresentation of the facts about Global Warming and his claims that the whole scientific community is behind him; I personally think he doesn't care about Global Warming all that much and just loves all this attention and wealth that he is accumulating.&#160; But that is a discussion for another time and place...</p>  <p>Well, to keep this brief, there is a new documentary coming out in movie theaters around the nation tomorrow by Ben Stein.&#160; It is called <u>Expelled</u>, and it is an investigative documentary around the systematic persecution by &quot;Big Science&quot; against anyone who questions the theory of Darwinism and proposes the idea that there might have been Intelligent Design.&#160; The movie is a campaign to convince &quot;Big Science&quot; of their close-mindedness, and I support this movement and hope it succeeds.</p>  <p>Here are some links if you are interested further:</p>  <ul>   <li>Trailer:&#160; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGCxbhGaVfE">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGCxbhGaVfE</a> </li>    <li>Movie Theater Locater:&#160; <a title="http://www.expelledthemovie.com/theaterap.php" href="http://www.expelledthemovie.com/theaterap.php">http://www.expelledthemovie.com/theaterap.php</a> </li>    <li>2 Official Web Sites:      <ul>       <li><a href="http://www.getexpelled.com/">http://www.getexpelled.com/</a> </li>        <li><a href="http://www.expelledthemovie.com/">http://www.expelledthemovie.com/</a> </li>     </ul>   </li> </ul>  <p>Ok, back to programming now!</p></div>
