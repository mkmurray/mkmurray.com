<div class='post'>
<p>So I'm really excited to start using Visual Studio 2008 and LINQ.&#160; A few of the guys here at work are learning it and will hopefully be giving us a little presentation in the next few weeks about how they used it in one of our projects.&#160; They have been learning it with the help of the following tutorial, which I hope to read through in the next few days:&#160; <a title="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/05/19/using-linq-to-sql-part-1.aspx" href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/05/19/using-linq-to-sql-part-1.aspx">http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/05/19/using-linq-to-sql-part-1.aspx</a></p>  <p>By the way, it's a 9-part series of blog posts (if you care to get that into it).</p>  </div>
