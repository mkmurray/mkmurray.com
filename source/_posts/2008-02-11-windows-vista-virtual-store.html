<p>Vista has a security &quot;feature&quot; that locks down certain system folders (for instance <font face="Courier New">Program Files</font>) from programmatic modifications.&#160; However, it doesn't just deny your IO requests; instead it <u>may or may not</u> redirect it to some virtual store elsewhere on the file system (it's per-user too, so that could further screw your code up if you were writing out something global or machine-wide).&#160; The best part is you don't know if you were redirected or not.&#160; I've had it where I was being redirected to the virtualized location for writes and then when I attempted to read later, it wouldn't redirect me and I would be reading from the real <font face="Courier New">Program Files</font>.&#160; Another odd thing is that it appeared to always read and write from the real <font face="Courier New">Program Files</font> location if the context was that of a locally-hosted web site.</p> <span class='fullpost'> <p>Here's another blogger's discovery of it for further information:&#160; <a title="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/VistasShowCompatibilityFilesAndTheScrumptiousWonderThatIsFileVirtualization.aspx" href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/VistasShowCompatibilityFilesAndTheScrumptiousWonderThatIsFileVirtualization.aspx">http://www.hanselman.com/blog/VistasShowCompatibilityFilesAndTheScrumptiousWonderThatIsFileVirtualization.aspx</a></p>  <p>I don't know why I didn't know anything about this until now, but I quickly learned about .NET's Isolated Storage APIs.&#160; Pretty useful for persisting configurations and such.&#160; It was the solution to my problem in this case.&#160; Here is a good article on it:&#160; <a title="http://www.developer.com/net/net/article.php/3430541" href="http://www.developer.com/net/net/article.php/3430541">http://www.developer.com/net/net/article.php/3430541</a></p>  <p>I will warn you though that you should try to do the reading and writing from the same assembly from within the same application; otherwise, you end up getting different isolated storage stores for each call.&#160; According to the many documents I read there is a way to call into a certain store even if .NET doesn't normally map your assembly and/or application to that location (you have to provide something called <font face="Courier New">Evidence</font>).&#160; I couldn't get it to work and was running short on time.</p> </span>  </div>
