<p>If you are using LINQ-to-SQL, it is often helpful to see the SQL generated and the resultant query results.&#160; You can do this, even while debugging, with the LINQ to SQL Debug Visualizer.&#160; Debug Visualizers are the dialogs that pop up when you hover over a statement and click the little magnifying glass in the hovering menu.</p>  <p>I believe by default Visual Studio will show you the generated SQL when you over over a LINQ statement, but there is no way Debug Visualizer to help see the SQL in a more user-friendly view.&#160; Scott Guthrie gave a blog post describing a simple download that can give you this enhanced view of the SQL, and even the ability to execute the query and see the raw data returned from your database:</p>  <p><a title="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/07/31/linq-to-sql-debug-visualizer.aspx" href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/07/31/linq-to-sql-debug-visualizer.aspx">http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/07/31/linq-to-sql-debug-visualizer.aspx</a></p>  <p>Included in the post are instructions of how to extract the necessary DLL library, and where to place it in Visual Studio's file hierarchy.</p>  <p>A really simple enhancement for working with and debugging LINQ-to-SQL that is definitely worth the minimal effort to acquire it.</p>  </div>
