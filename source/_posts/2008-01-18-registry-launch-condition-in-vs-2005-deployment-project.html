<p>I have a Visual Studio 2005 deployment project where I wanted to add a launch condition that would check the registry for a key before continuing.&#160; This article is really straight forward about how to do that:&#160; <a title="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/4awx1f1d(VS.80).aspx" href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/4awx1f1d(VS.80).aspx">http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/4awx1f1d(VS.80).aspx</a></p>  <p>However, every time I put the registry path in, it would never find the key upon install.&#160; So the key was located at something like <font face="Courier New">HKLM\SOFTWARE\MyCompany\MyProduct</font> and then there was a Value named <font face="Courier New">Target Path</font> that I wanted to check if it existed.&#160; My understanding (and perhaps I'm wrong) that keys are keys but the values are keys also (at least it seems that way when doing registry stuff through the .NET APIs in C#).&#160; So when I saw the following statement in the above article, I thought the property was for testing the value of a <font face="Courier New">Value</font> (AKA key?):</p>  <blockquote>   <p><font face="Courier New">&quot;Optionally, set the <strong><u>Value</u></strong> property to search for a specific value in the registry key.&quot;</font></p> </blockquote>  <p>Essentially I tried to append the <font face="Courier New">Value</font> to the <font face="Courier New">RegKey</font> path, because I thought the <font face="Courier New">Value</font> property was only for testing the value of the <font face="Courier New">Value</font>.&#160; If you want to test the value of the <font face="Courier New">Value</font>, you do it in the <font face="Courier New">Condition</font> property of the <font face="Courier New">Property</font> created by the registry launch condition.&#160; Is that as clear as mud? </p>  <p>This article is what cleared up my confusion (the 2nd post, the one by Phil Wilson):&#160; <a title="http://www.dotnet247.com/247reference/msgs/49/246890.aspx" href="http://www.dotnet247.com/247reference/msgs/49/246890.aspx">http://www.dotnet247.com/247reference/msgs/49/246890.aspx</a> </p>  <p>I realized that a registry <font face="Courier New">Value</font> should not be part of the <font face="Courier New">RegKey</font> path.</p>  </div>
