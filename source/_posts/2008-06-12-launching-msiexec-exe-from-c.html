<p>I ran into a problem with trying to spawn off a process to launch an <font face="Courier New">MSIExec.exe</font> command from C#.&#160; I wanted to launch the process and then wait for it to finish before proceeding; however,&#160; it was always returned immediately before the install or uninstall was really finished.&#160; I confirmed this behavior with this blog entry:&#160; <a title="http://blogs.msdn.com/heaths/archive/2005/11/15/493236.aspx" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/heaths/archive/2005/11/15/493236.aspx">http://blogs.msdn.com/heaths/archive/2005/11/15/493236.aspx</a></p>  <p>The author suggests &quot;<font face="Courier New">start /wait</font>&quot; which works from the command line or a batch file.&#160; I did verify it works launching a batch file or two from C#, but I preferred to keep in C# as much as possible.&#160; Also, I was trying to accomplish a silent background process running the <font face="Courier New">MSIExec</font> commands.&#160; However, C# can't just start a process calling &quot;<font face="Courier New">start</font>,&quot; which is an internal command to the Command Prompt I guess.</p>  <p>Someone reminded me on a message board that you can start a process using <font face="Courier New">CMD.exe</font>, calling &quot;<font face="Courier New">start</font>&quot; like this:</p> <span class='fullpost'> <p><pre class="code"><span style="color: #2b91af">ProcessStartInfo </span>startInfo = <span style="color: blue">new </span><span style="color: #2b91af">ProcessStartInfo</span>(
    <span style="color: #a31515">&quot;cmd.exe&quot;</span>,
    <span style="color: blue">string</span>.Format(<span style="color: #a31515">&quot;/c start /MIN /wait msiexec.exe /x {0} /quiet&quot;</span>, guid));
startInfo.WindowStyle = <span style="color: #2b91af">ProcessWindowStyle</span>.Hidden;

<span style="color: #2b91af">Process </span>process = <span style="color: #2b91af">Process</span>.Start(startInfo);
process.WaitForExit();</pre></p> <p>It works like a charm.&#160; I don't think you even need the &quot;<font face="Courier New">/MIN</font>&quot; flag for &quot;<font face="Courier New">start</font>&quot; anyway.</p>

You could use process.WaitForExit() isn&#39;t it?</div>
