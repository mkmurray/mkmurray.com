<p>So I just finished migrating a whole slew of our large solutions and projects from Visual Studio 2005 to Visual Studio 2008.&#160; The conversion process itself was really simple and painless (and not too time consuming).&#160; There were a few gotchas with our Setup (AKA Deployment) Projects however:</p> <span class='fullpost'> <ol>   <li>It appears that Microsoft moved the location of it's prerequisite packages for the BootStrapper for VS 2008.&#160; Microsoft used to keep them at <font face="Courier New">C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\SDK\v2.0\BootStrapper\Packages</font>, but now in 2008 it looks they have moved them to a more isolated and common location.&#160; The new location is <font face="Courier New">C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.0A\Bootstrapper\Packages</font>.&#160; When I converted our setup projects to VS 2008 format, some of the prerequisites couldn't be found because of this.&#160; I just went to the old VS 2005 BootStrapper location and copied the folders of the packages I needed to the new VS 2008 location (for example, the <font face="Courier New">MDAC</font> package is under a folder called <font face="Courier New">MDAC28</font>, and it is not in VS 2008's list of packages by default anymore). </li>    <li>We had a folder structure into which we were dropping the <font face="Courier New">Primary Output</font> of a web application in our setup projects.&#160; For a web application project, the <font face="Courier New">Primary Output</font> is the DLL libraries in the <font face="Courier New">bin</font> directory of the web site.&#160; In VS 2005, you would create a <font face="Courier New">bin</font> folder at the root level of the web site and put the <font face="Courier New">Primary Output</font> down a level in the <font face="Courier New">bin</font> folder.&#160; Well, now in VS 2008, it appears that wherever you put the <font face="Courier New">Project Output</font>, the setup project will create a <font face="Courier New">bin</font> folder at that location and put the DLL libraries in that <font face="Courier New">bin</font> folder one level down from where you put the <font face="Courier New">Project Output</font>.&#160; So I had to go back through our setup projects and move the location of those <font face="Courier New">Primary Outputs</font> one level up (or else it would create a <font face="Courier New">bin </font>folder inside of the <font face="Courier New">bin</font> folder). </li> </ol>  <p>One nice thing about the migration to VS 2008 is that it looks like Microsoft has a new version of the <font face="Courier New">Visual C++ Runtime Libraries</font> prerequisite (I don't know if the libraries are actually any different, but at least the redistributable package and logic are improved).&#160; We have a set of products that have this package as a prerequisite during install.&#160; Every time you ran the installer it would reinstall the package.&#160; It was almost as if it wasn't doing any logic to detect if it already had the package installed.&#160; The following link might be the explanation of why we were seeing this odd behavior (even though it references the <font face="Courier New">MDAC</font> package):&#160; <a title="http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=339044&amp;SiteID=1" href="http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=339044&amp;SiteID=1">http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=339044&amp;SiteID=1</a></p>  <p>Well, the new <font face="Courier New">Visual C++ Runtime Libraries</font> package works great and doesn't keep reinstalling itself as a prerequisite with every install or update of one of our products that depend on it.</p>  <p><strong><u>FOLLOWUP (06/19/08)</u></strong>:&#160; Actually, we ended it up having to revert back to the <font face="Courier New">Visual C++ Runtime Libraries</font> from Visual Studio 2005, as another prerequisite we were using (<a href="http://www.dtsearch.com/">DTSearch</a>) wasn't compatible with the new C++ libraries with VS 2008.&#160; We'll check again next year.</p> </span>  </div>

This is extraordinary!  As per comment your post 2, folder structure.<br /><br />I am actually moving straight from 2005 to 2010, and had come across just this problem.  I hadn&#39;t thought it might actually emanate from 2008 in the first place.  And this was the only thread I could find covering just this.  I am in process of moving the POs one level up...</div>

Your number 2 post regarding folder structure was the first I&#39;ve seen of its kind.  I was particularly confused since each converted solution I tried gave a Parser error.  I&#39;ve been researching this issue for days why our 2005 solutions haven&#39;t been converted to 2008 successfully.  Thanks so much for posting this info!</div>
