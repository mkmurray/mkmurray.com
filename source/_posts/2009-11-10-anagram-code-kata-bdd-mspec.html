<p>Many forms of martial arts utilize the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata" target="_blank">kata</a> as a means for detailed, focused practice and training.&#160; The power of this practice comes from repetition and focus on simple fundamentals, “while attempting to maintain perfect form.”&#160; The principle goal is to “try out different combinations of techniques in a safe, practice environment to ultimately find out how to defeat your opponent”.&#160; In the last few years, this concept has taken hold within the software development world in the form of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_Kata" target="_blank">Code Kata</a>, a phrase coined by <a href="http://pragprog.com/" target="_blank">Pragmatic Programmer</a> <a href="http://pragdave.pragprog.com/" target="_blank">Dave Thomas</a> (and <a href="http://codekata.pragprog.com/" target="_blank">here is his blog dedicated to the Code Kata</a>).</p>  <p>My inspiration for all of this is <a href="http://www.davesquared.net/2009/10/calculators-and-tale-of-two-tdds-pt-1.html" target="_blank">David Tchepak’s Calculator Kata series of posts</a>.&#160; Hopefully he will stop by and provide some helpful guidance and advice.&#160; I have selected the <a href="http://codekata.pragprog.com/2007/01/kata_six_anagra.html" target="_blank">Anagram Kata (code kata number 6)</a> for me to practice.&#160; My goals for this series of posts are:</p>  <ul>   <li>To practice coding and share my learning experience with you, while also soliciting feedback and suggestions. </li>    <li>To more fully understand the concepts driving <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_Driven_Development" target="_blank">Behavior Driven Development (BDD)</a> via a testing framework designed for such a practice, namely <a href="http://blog.wekeroad.com/blog/make-bdd-your-bff-2/" target="_blank">MSpec</a>. </li>    <li>To keep to the <a href="http://www.davesquared.net/2009/01/introduction-to-solid-principles-of-oo.html" target="_blank">SOLID principles of Object-Oriented Design</a>, especially <a href="http://www.davesquared.net/2009/11/favour-test-driving-logic-over-data.html" target="_blank">in favor of test driving logic over just testing data</a>. </li> </ul>  <p>Below I will keep an updated list of blog posts in this series.&#160; Hope you enjoy it!</p>  <ul>   <li><a href="http://murrayon.net/2009/11/anagram-code-kata-part-1-getting.html">Part 1 – Getting Started</a> </li>    <li><a href="http://murrayon.net/2009/11/anagram-code-kata-part-2-mocking-and.html" target="_blank">Part 2 – Mocking and SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)</a> </li>    <li><a href="http://murrayon.net/2009/12/anagram-code-kata-part-3-use-common.html" target="_blank">Part 3 – Use Common Sense</a> </li>    <li><a href="http://murrayon.net/2010/01/anagram-code-kata-part-4-will-it-write.html">Part 4 – Will it Write My Code for Me?</a></li>    <li><a href="http://murrayon.net/2010/02/anagram-code-kata-part-5-domain-objects.html">Part 5 – Domain Objects Over Language Primitives</a>&#160;</li> </ul>  <p><strong><u>UPDATE (07/18/10)</u></strong>:&#160; I was asked where the source code to this post series could be found.&#160; I decided to host it at BitBucket.org using Mercurial for the source control:&#160; <a href="http://bitbucket.org/murrayondotnet/anagramkata/">http://bitbucket.org/murrayondotnet/anagramkata/</a></p></div>
