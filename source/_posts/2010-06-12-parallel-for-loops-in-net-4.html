<p>I was having fun working on the <a href="http://toughestdeveloperpuzzleever.com/tdpe2/">Toughest Developer Puzzle Ever 2</a> when I came across a problem that asked for the coordinates into a grid of numbers of the upper left corner for a 4x4 sub-grid with a magic sum of 34, meaning all rows, columns, and the 2 diagonals all sum up to 34.&#160; Instead of trying to figure it out manually, I probably did what many programmers would do and wrote a quick and dirty program to accomplish the task for me.</p>  <p>I didn’t try to use any optimized search algorithm or anything, as I knew that the problem space was very small and specific and that computers are really fast.&#160; So I figured I would just write a brute-force iterate through every row and column type of an algorithm (in Big O notation being <font face="Courier New">O(mn)</font> or just <font face="Courier New">O(n<span style="font-size:xx-small; vertical-align:top;">2</span>)</font> if the original grid is square), knowing it would return in milliseconds.</p>  <p>I quickly realized that each iteration was not dependent any previous iteration for its calculations, so I decided it might be a good time to try out the new <font face="Courier New">Parallel.For</font> loops in the .NET 4 Framework that would multi-thread the iterations of the loops.&#160; Here’s the implementation I threw together:</p> <span class="fullpost">   <pre class="brush: csharp">using System;

namespace Find34Grid
{
    public class Program
    {
        private static readonly int[][] Grid = new []
        {
            new [] {16,3,2,13,15,10,3,6,41,15,14,4,12,8,7,1,12},
            new [] {5,10,22,8,4,5,16,7,9,7,6,12,5,11,10,8,5},
            new [] {9,6,7,12,14,11,2,13,16,3,2,13,15,10,3,6,5},

<p>Nothing special and certainly did the job.&#160; I didn’t really notice a performance improvement in anyway, but that was expected for such a small problem.&#160; I don’t really expect a whole lot of feedback on such straightforward code, but if there is a cleaner or more efficient way to utilize <font face="Courier New">Parallel.For</font> or <font face="Courier New">Parallel.ForEach</font>, please don’t hesitate to let me know via commenting to this post.&#160; Thanks!</p>
