		<p>As a dev team, we have been watching and discussing various training videos and
conference talks every morning for a few months now. This week we watched a
recorded conference talk by Ruby developer <a href="http://kytrinyx.com/">Katrina Owen</a>
entitled <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4dlF0kcThQ">Therapeutic Refactoring</a>.
I was especially impressed with her strategy for refactoring legacy code.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sure everyone can agree that the safest way to refactor code and be 100%
positive that the functionality hasn&#8217;t regressed is to have a good suite of
tests. And if you don&#8217;t have sufficient test coverage (or any at all), then now
is the right time to add it before refactoring.</p>

<p>However, I have found myself skipping this step in the past, feeling justified
because the quality of the code was so poor or the deadline was so short. It is
irresponsible of me to assume that I have not changed the functionality of the
code with no proof in the form of passing tests that sufficiently cover all
scenarios and use cases.  Nonetheless, watching Katrina&#8217;s presentation has
given me renewed commitment and a sound plan of attack against legacy code that
may be ugly and very unfamiliar to me.</p>

<p>Here is the example method that Katrina uses during her presentation (which is
later revealed as a piece of code that she vaguely remembers coding herself and
now abhors):</p>

<pre class="brush: ruby">
    module XYZService

      def self.xyz_filename(target)
        # File format:
        # [day of month zero-padded][three-letter prefix] \
        # _[kind]_[age_if_kind_personal]_[target.id] \
        # _[8 random chars]_[10 first chars of title].jpg
        filename = "#{target.publish_on.strftime("%d")}"
        filename << "#{target.xyz_category_prefix}"
        filename << "#{target.kind.gsub("_", "")}"
        filename << "_%03d" % (target.age || 0) if target.personal?
        filename << "_#{target.id.to_s}"
        filename << "_#{Digest::SHA1.hexdigest(rand(10000).to_s)[0,8]}"
        truncated_title = target.title.gsub(/[^\[a-z\]]/i, '').downcase
        truncate_to = truncated_title.length > 9 ? 9 : truncated_title.length
        filename << "_#{truncated_title[0..(truncate_to)]}"
        filename << ".jpg"
        return filename
      end

    end
</pre>


<p>It certainly isn&#8217;t the worst lines of code ever written and it is getting the
job done, but it is definitely not very readable and quite difficult to
understand its purpose and logic. About the only thing that can be discerned is
that it is intended to generate a filename in a specific format.</p>

<p>Katrina starts by writing a very simple and seemlingly useless test (which she
calls a &#8220;Mickey Mouse test&#8221; in her GitHub commit message) in order to begin test
coverage of this method:</p>

<pre class="brush: ruby">
    require_relative './xyz_service'

    describe XYZService do

      let(:target) do
        stub(:target)
      end

      subject { XYZService.xyz_filename(target) }

      it 'works' do
        subject.should eq('something')
      end

    end
</pre>


<p>Without much knowledge of what this method&#8217;s purpose or inputs are, we can only
pass in an empty stub object as input and then assert something rediculous for
the result. We expect this test to not only fail to pass, but it is also likely
to error during runtime (or even at compile time if in a statically typed
language like C#). The idea is to create a quick feedback loop that aids us in
finding the context and inputs required to make the code execute without runtime
error. Then we can finally see the actual return value and modify our dummy
assertion to begin expecting that output.</p>

<p>After iterating in this fashion, Katrina arrives at the following test which is
a bit more useful:</p>

<pre class="brush: ruby">
    require_relative './xyz_service'
    require 'date'

    describe XYZService do

      let(:target) do
        messages = {
          :publish_on => Date.new(2012, 3, 14),
          :xyz_category_prefix => 'abc',
          :kind => 'unicorn',
          :personal? => false,
          :id => 1337,
          :title => 'magic & superglue'
        }
        stub(:target, messages)
      end

      subject { XYZService.xyz_filename(target) }

      it 'works' do
        subject.should eq('14abcunicorn_1337_cb6c53bc_magicsuper.jpg')
      end

    end
</pre>


<p>However, this test doesn&#8217;t pass because the <code>cb6c53bc</code> portion of the resultant
filename is different every execution of the test. A simple regex allows the
test to pass all of the time:</p>

<pre class="brush: ruby">
    subject.should match(/14abcunicorn_1337_[0-9a-f]{8}_magicsuper\.jpg/)
</pre>


<p>Even though we now have a passing test, we have not yet exercised the different
input values and all code paths and branches through the method. This must be
done in order to fully understand, document, and test cover the logic and
purpose of the method. This would be done in the normal unit testing fashion
that is shown in just about every testing demo by adding more test scenarios and
assertions that excercise the varying use cases.</p>

<p>One interesting development that occurred while Katrina was using this process
was that she actually found a bug in the implementation of the original
<code>xyz_filename</code> method, specifically an extra set of braces in the regex on line
14.</p>

<p>Now that we are fully covered with tests (and a bug fixed), we are free to
refactor the code into smaller, more readable chunks of code logic that are more
cohesive and more reusable as well. This is what Katrina does for the remainder
of her presentation, and it is just as instructive as this first part. However,
today I wanted to focus on her strategy for writing test coverage against a
legacy codebase.</p>

<p>I like how what Katrina is demonstrating seems to utilize a black box testing
approach at first, and then progresses to a more white box approach as we begin
to explore the different parts of the implementation. Perhaps such a strategy
should have been obvious to me, but Katrina&#8217;s conference talk really struck a
chord with me and encouraged me to commit to doing better with test coverage in
legacy codebases before I begin making modifications or additions.</p>

<p>I highly recommend viewing the entire video, as it is only 30 minutes long and
an entertaining watch.</p>

		<p>I learned about a pair of SQL keywords I didn&#8217;t know existed before. I suppose I shouldn&#8217;t have been so surprised
this ability existed in SQL since I knew it existed within Excel spreadsheets, but it really saved the day this
last week. I&#8217;m speaking of the <code>PIVOT</code> and <code>UNPIVOT</code> SQL keywords.</p>

<p>This last week I needed to track down some data inconsistencies in our database by joining a few view model tables.
These tables are populated by event handlers that denormalize the relevant data from events into a view model
table that serves the needs of a specific part of the UI. In one particular view model table, it made sense to
arrange the data points specific to each US state as columns on a single row. This allowed for a grid-based UI that
enables batch operations on many rows at one time. A second view model table was intended for a different use case
and was designed so that the state-specific data points became a one-to-many relationship across multiple rows and
only two columns for the key-value pair of the US state and its associated data point value. These were two of the
tables I needed to join together during my database inquisition.</p>

<p>At this point I figured I was stuck, as I couldn&#8217;t see a sensible way to join two tables designed so contrary to
each other for the purposes of joining. I tried to think of any ways to dynamically join tables on a column name
in one table specified by the value in the other table&#8217;s row. I knew I was heading nowhere fast, so I asked our
DBA for some ideas. He informed me of the <code>PIVOT</code> and <code>UNPIVOT</code> keywords in SQL as one option to solve the problem.
We reasoned that even though it may not be the most efficient feature, the likelihood of it proving to be a
performance bottleneck would be essentially non-existent (given that the entire size of the data set was relatively
small, on the magnitude of hundreds or thousands of rows instead of millions of rows). And so I gave it a go.</p>

<p>I will now describe an example scenario in order to illustrate how I used the <code>UNPIVOT</code> feature to join two tables
that didn&#8217;t seem at all compatible. The goal will be to join a table representing what US states each product is
available for sale within to a table representing how many of each product are being sold in each state. We will
call the first table <code>ProductAvailability</code> and give it an integer identity column named <code>Id</code>, an integer column
named <code>ProductId</code>, and then 52 <code>bit</code> columns indicating the availability status of the product in each of the 50 US
states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. These columns will be named by their two letter abbreviations of
<code>AK</code> through <code>WY</code>. The second table we will call <code>ProductSales</code> and it will also have an integer identity column
named <code>Id</code> and an integer column named <code>ProductId</code>. In addition it will have a string column (specifically
<code>char(2)</code>) named <code>StateCode</code> and an integer column named <code>TotalSales</code>.</p>

<p>The unpivoting of the <code>ProductAvailability</code> table to prepare it for joining can be done like so:</p>

<pre class="brush: sql">
    SELECT
      Unpivoted.ProductId,
      Unpivoted.StateCode,
      Unpivoted.IsAvailable
    FROM ProductAvailability
    UNPIVOT
    (
      IsAvailable FOR StateCode
      IN (AK,AL,AR,AZ,CA,CO,CT,
          DC,DE,FL,GA,HI,IA,ID,
          IL,IN,KS,KY,LA,MA,MD,
          ME,MI,MN,MO,MS,MT,NC,
          ND,NE,NH,NJ,NM,NV,NY,
          OH,OK,OR,PA,PR,RI,SC,
          SD,TN,TX,UT,VA,VT,WA,
          WI,WV,WY)
    ) AS Unpivoted
</pre>


<p>The interesting part is obviously the <code>UNPIVOT</code> clause. Here we are declaring a list of column names to unpivot and
also naming two new columns in which to place the old column&#8217;s name and value (<code>StateCode</code> and <code>IsAvailable</code>
respectively). The result is that instead of having one row of 54 columns for each product, we now have 52 rows of
three columns to describe the exact same availability of the product. But with this second schema, we can more
easily join with the <code>ProductSales</code> table.</p>

<p>Here is an example of such a query where we are trying to find the products which have no sales in a state for
which it is marked as available for sale:</p>

<pre class="brush: sql">
    SELECT
      ProductStateAvailability.ProductId,
      ProductStateAvailability.StateCode
    FROM
    (
      SELECT
        Unpivoted.ProductId,
        Unpivoted.StateCode,
        Unpivoted.IsAvailable
      FROM ProductAvailability
      UNPIVOT
      (
        IsAvailable FOR StateCode
        IN (AK,AL,AR,AZ,CA,CO,CT,
            DC,DE,FL,GA,HI,IA,ID,
            IL,IN,KS,KY,LA,MA,MD,
            ME,MI,MN,MO,MS,MT,NC,
            ND,NE,NH,NJ,NM,NV,NY,
            OH,OK,OR,PA,PR,RI,SC,
            SD,TN,TX,UT,VA,VT,WA,
            WI,WV,WY)
      ) AS Unpivoted
      WHERE Unpivoted.IsAvailable = 1
    ) AS ProductStateAvailability
    INNER JOIN ProductSales
      ON ProductSales.StateCode = ProductStateAvailability.StateCode
      AND ProductSales.ProductId = ProductStateAvailability.ProductId
    WHERE ProductSales.TotalSales = 0
</pre>


<p>I hope you find the <code>PIVOT</code> and <code>UNPIVOT</code> SQL keywords just as helpful as I did if you ever find yourself in a bind
with two tables that are seemingly impossible to join.</p>

<p>For the last several months at work, we have been gradually migrating our production website to use the .NET open source <a href="http://fubumvc.com/" target="_blank">FubuMVC web framework</a>. Before committing to a whole new infrastructure for our site, some brilliant talent on our team decided to improve our experience on the ASP.NET MVC framework by integrating in one of FubuMVC’s most compelling features, behavior chains. <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/bob_pace" target="_blank">Bob Pace</a> originally blogged about the process in a two part blog post series (<a href="http://paceyourself.net/2010/08/06/integrating-fubumvc-with-aspnet-mvc-part-1/" target="_blank">part 1</a> and <a href="http://paceyourself.net/2010/08/13/integrating-fubumvc-with-aspnet-mvc-part-2/" target="_blank">part 2</a>); since then, he has <a href="https://github.com/bobpace/MvcToFubu" target="_blank">created a packaged solution called MvcToFubu</a> which he <a href="http://paceyourself.net/2011/06/11/mvctofubu---transition-your-website-from-aspnet-mvc-to-fubumvc-part-1/" target="_blank">just recently started another blog post series about</a>.</p>  <p>Behavior chains are by far my favorite feature of FubuMVC. I believe they single-handedly revolutionized our use of the MVC pattern in a web environment. In fact, I like to think of it as a whole new pattern, the <strong>BMVC Pattern</strong> (I was told by a coworker that the ‘B’ should stand for “Better”, and while that’s true, I’ll stick with “Behaviors”). No, I’m not sincerely trying to coin yet another design or architectural pattern buzzword. However, I am most sincerely not joking when I say behavior chains add a whole new dimension to how I design web architectures. I find myself creating composable pipelines of cohesive, testable components in lieu of monolithic controllers and actions.</p> <span class="fullpost">   <h3>What are Behavior Chains?</h3>    <p>Have you ever looked at your controller actions and thought “Man, there’s a lot going on here!” (validation, authorization, transactions, ORM setup, logging, caching, etc.)? If you haven’t, I urge you to take a conscious look at your controller actions and try to identify code that doesn’t <u>directly</u> relate to the purpose of the page (or sub-view of the page). Shouldn’t there be a way to move some of this secondary infrastructure code out of our controller actions and have it be applied conventionally to the correct actions/routes? Yes, and this is exactly what Behavior Chains are meant to accomplish, the ability to create composable pipelines of reusable behavior nodes for each route in your site.</p>    <p>Behavior chains can be built up in any order you want for each route via Conventions and Policies, which are extension points that allow you to inspect and modify the entire Behavior Graph that was built by FubuMVC during startup bootstrapping. The behavior graph is the modifiable collection of all behavior chains in the site, initially built with just a few default behavior nodes for each route. A typical behavior chain by default usually has an ActionCall node (representing the call to a controller action) and an Output node (often a tie-in to a view rendering engine, but can also be JSON or anything else). Other behavior nodes can be sprinkled into the pipeline in any order in front of or in between the ActionCall and the Output nodes. As mentioned before via the use of Conventions and Policies, it is common practice to filter your list of behavior chains using LINQ extension methods and then add a specific behavior node into the matching chains at a specific location in the chain. This truly elevates coding to conventions to a new level; some of the filtering criteria regarding controller actions that you may come up with could be as follows:</p>    <ul>     <li>Action method names that contain a certain word. </li>      <li>Actions methods that are located in a particular controller or namespace. </li>      <li>Action method signatures that contain an input/output model that implements a specific interface. </li>      <li>Action method signatures that contain an input/output model that contains a property of a certain type or have a particular C# attribute applied to it. </li>      <li>So on, so forth…whatever you can dream up! </li>   </ul>    <p>One more aspect of behavior chains that is important to point out is the logistics in how behavior nodes are chained together. The chains are not merely a linked-list of behavior nodes that are traversed linearly. Instead the makeup of the chains is better conceptualized to be an outer behavior node wrapping around an inner behavior node, which is then itself an outer node wrapped around another inner node, and so on. In fact, the FubuMVC developers like to refer to this chaining architecture as the Onion Layer Model or the Russian Doll Model (conjuring up a mental image of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matryoshka_doll">nesting Russian doll toy called a matryoshka doll or a babushka doll</a>). When an outer behavior node has finished executing it’s logic, it can then optionally execute it’s inner behavior node logic (or stop the behavior chain entirely in order to return early with a response, an error, or even transfer to a different route and behavior chain). One of the key advantages that this wrapping architecture can afford is the ability for an outer behavior to run additional logic or clean up code after all inner behavior nodes have completed (i.e., transactions can be committed, connections can be closed, sessions can be disposed, etc.).</p>    <h3>How does this change the way I code my controllers?</h3>    <p>I find that my controller actions are much thinner and more focused on the base case and the successful code path. All the exceptional code paths and edge cases have been identified and deal with by the other behavior nodes in the chain, prior to my action call being invoked. My action call can now focus on the essential logic that differentiate this route from others. That essential logic doesn’t get lost anymore in the necessary infrastructure code that should be a secondary concern. And all of this logic can be broken up into cohesive, reusable components within a flexible request/response pipeline that can be built up automatically by coding to whatever conventions you deem beneficial. Behavior chains really do add a whole new first-class citizen to the MVC design pattern. Do yourself a favor and check out the MvcToFubu solution mentioned at the top of this post, and bring some FubuMVC behavior chain goodness to your ASP.NET MVC website. I think you might be as impressed as we were and yearn for <a href="http://lostechies.com/chadmyers/2011/05/30/cool-stuff-in-fubucore-and-fubumvc-series/">the other killer features of FubuMVC</a> as well.</p> </span>  </div>

Thanks for thought! Perhaps I&#39;ll post on the mailing list and see what others think about it being involved in the FubuMVC documentation somewhere.</div>

Great post, I didn&#39;t see this one when I was writing my post about authentication behavior. This is a great explanation of behavior chains in FubuMVC.<br /><br />This would also be a great intro to behaviors for the fubumvc guides.</div>

<p>It came to my attention recently that there are a few companies in other dev circles with all-star developers who give back to their communities by doing apprenticeship programs or open door programs at their workplaces. Basically the idea is to let people come into your workplace and pair program with them, sharing knowledge and best practices. I believe we need more of this sense of community going on in the .NET space. I’m sure I’ve probably overlooked something (or perhaps I’m about to spout off craziness and heresies), but it just seems like we should be able to work out the logistics to make this a reality.</p> <span class="fullpost">   <p>The interesting thing is that this really isn’t a new concept in other professions. For example, the culinary world has had the idea of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stage_(cooking)">staging</a> for quite a while. Sometimes it’s a final part of an interview process and other times it’s just to swap techniques and recipes. As mentioned above, I was recently informed of a few dev companies that have taken this idea to our profession. In the Rails community, <a href="http://hashrocket.com/people/work-at-hashrocket/apprentice">Hashrocket has an apprenticeship program</a> where you can apply to be a part of their team for a week and soak in some of the awesome skills and techniques they possess. It appears they vet their candidates a bit to ensure they get the right kind of people coming in who are motivated and ready to learn, and also because the code being worked on is for real Hashrocket projects for their clients. In the Node.js space, <a href="http://joyeur.com/2011/04/05/events-ssjs-office-hours-and-codeconf/">Joyent has a program called Office Hours</a> where devs can register for free in advance to bring in something to work on with a Joyent employee at end of work day and get their feedback &amp; expert advice. They provide snacks, drinks, and a comfortable work environment.</p>    <p>I think these ideas are brilliant and foster real community among developers. Although this idea alone can improve the interview and hiring process, I think it can go further than that to help our profession mature in the sharing of best practices and proven techniques. For most .NET companies out there, I’m willing to bet there are few legitimate roadblocks that would prevent instituting programs like these. Being completely honest with yourself, how much of what you work on each day is top secret intellectual property that is core to the success of your company and absolutely cannot be seen by outsiders? Even if there are parts of your code that should not be seen by strangers, I’m sure there are projects and tasks to be done on the other parts of code that will still prove instructive for your invited guests. I encourage our dev community to do whatever it takes to make this happen: have the visitors sign non-disclosure agreements, interview and re-interview potential candidates to meet satisfactory requirements, don’t allow them to hook up thumb drives to your machine and steal your secrets, whatever! It doesn’t matter if it’s a week-long thing or a few hours; let’s realize we’re all in this together and build this community up to have a higher standard of software craftsmanship.</p> </span>  </div>
