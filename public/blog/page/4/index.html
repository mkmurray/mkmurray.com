<p>This post is part of a <a href="http://murrayon.net/2009/11/anagram-code-kata-bdd-mspec.html">series on coding Kata, BDD, MSpec, and SOLID principles</a>.&#160; Feel free to visit the above link which points to the introductory post, also containing an index of all posts in the series.</p>  <p>In this post, we will rewrite our <a href="http://murrayon.net/2009/11/anagram-code-kata-part-1-getting.html" target="_blank">first specification/test from the previous post</a>, where we didn’t feel very confident about the direction we were heading.&#160; We got some great feedback and will now better <a href="http://www.davesquared.net/2009/11/favour-test-driving-logic-over-data.html" target="_blank">focus on test driving logic and not just data</a>; we will also be more careful in extracting the requirements from problem statement and in giving our classes a <a href="http://www.davesquared.net/2009/01/introduction-to-solid-principles-of-oo.html" target="_blank">Single Responsibility (the first of the SOLID principles of Object-Oriented Design)</a>.&#160; As we are test driving our design from a “top-down” perspective, we will encounter the need for dependencies not yet implemented while creating the higher level classes.&#160; Instead of halting our rhythm and progress, we will utilize a mocking framework to stub out non-existent implementations according to interfaces.&#160; This also encourages us to use <a href="http://www.davesquared.net/2009/01/introduction-to-solid-principles-of-oo.html" target="_blank">Dependency Inversion (last of the SOLID principles; same link as above)</a> and we can prove the validity of our modules by testing them in complete isolation from their dependencies.</p> <span class="fullpost">   <h3>Don’t Focus on Data (Yet) and SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)</h3>    <p>I had a feeling I was focusing too much on testing data, and I also knew it seemed to odd to be writing my very first test to be dependent on solving a specific instance of the problem (especially a test case with thousands of words in it), instead of working on solving the problem generally.&#160; After some terrific feedback from <a href="http://www.davesquared.net/" target="_blank">David Tchepak</a> in the <a href="http://murrayon.net/2009/11/anagram-code-kata-part-1-getting.html#comments" target="_blank">comments of my last post</a>, I now understand that wasn’t my only mistake.&#160; I was also trying to give my <font face="Courier New">AnagramsFinder</font> class too many responsibilities (especially with just one <font face="Courier New">ParseTextFile</font> method), namely extracting the words out of the text file and then grouping the anagrams together.&#160; Not only that, I also was returning a count of anagram sets when the <a href="http://codekata.pragprog.com/2007/01/kata_six_anagra.html" target="_blank">problem statement specifically asked for output of the anagram sets themselves</a>.&#160; Even though this is a simple problem scenario, it can be foolish to make assumptions or simplifications like I did that are not part of the requirements.</p>    <p>Let us first focus on the responsibilities required of our <font face="Courier New">AnagramsFinder</font> class.&#160; It needs to parse a list of words out of a text file given the file path and it also needs to group words together into sets that are anagrams of each other.&#160; However, we just named two responsibilities; implementing both in the same class would make it less cohesive and therefore less maintainable.&#160; This is because our class would have more than one responsibility that could change in the future, and because these responsibilities are in the same class, they could be considered coupled and one could be affected by modifications to the other.&#160; All of this train of thought falls under the Single Responsibility Principle from the SOLID principles (see links at the beginning of the post).</p>    <p>To solve this predicament, we will make <font face="Courier New">AnagramsFinder</font> a managing class of dependencies that individually solve these separate concerns.&#160; Each of these dependencies will adhere to the Single Responsibility principle, as does this higher abstraction manager class.&#160; Its responsibility can be summarized as managing the inputs, outputs, and execution order of its dependencies.&#160; We shall name the dependencies directly after each of their responsibilities, namely <font face="Courier New">FileParser</font> and <font face="Courier New">AnagramGrouper</font>.&#160; However, I don’t want to go implement these dependencies and throw off the flow of fleshing out the design and logic of my manager class.&#160; We are trying to design from a more “top-down” approach, instead of focusing on the lower level data concerns of the solution too early in the design process.&#160; To accomplish completing the design of our manager class without actually implementing the dependencies, we will code to interfaces (namely <font face="Courier New">IFileParser</font> and <font face="Courier New">IAnagramGrouper</font>).</p>    <h3>DIP (Dependency Inversion Principle)</h3>    <p>The advantages of using interfaces are that we abstract out the actual implementation of the dependencies, allowing us to be more modular and less coupled between dependencies.&#160; One class is not strongly tied to a specific implementation of its dependency, but rather the general contracts made available by the interface’s defined method signatures.&#160; What this really means is that we can swap out actual implementations of the dependency without the consuming class being modified in the least bit.&#160; This makes for truly maintainable code, especially when requirements change down the road after version one of the application is up and running.&#160; This is what the Dependency Inversion Principle (again, from SOLID) is all about.</p>    <p>We can take this a step further by passing the necessary dependencies into our consuming class at construction.&#160; This allows for us to “inject” into the object any implementation of the interface we see fit; this technique is aptly named Dependency Injection (DI).&#160; Our manager class doesn’t have to fret about any concrete details regarding its dependencies’ actual implementations, nor about any of the construction ceremony associated with “newing” up and initializing said dependencies.&#160; We won’t be using any DI containers (as our dependency needs are very light in this exercise), but the use of the Dependency Inversion Principle does set us up nicely to use a mocking framework so that we can finish fleshing out our tests without implementing any of the dependencies yet.</p>    <h3>Mocking Dependencies</h3>    <p>We would like to finish the design of our top level <font face="Courier New">AnagramsFinder</font> manager class, but not fully commit to how its dependencies will be implemented yet.&#160; We have a general idea of how we want our consuming class to interact with its dependencies via interfaces.&#160; Let’s go ahead and look at our interfaces we named earlier:</p>    <pre class="brush: csharp">public interface IFileParser
{
    IEnumerable&lt;string&gt; ExtractWordListFromFile(string filePath);
}

public interface IAnagramGrouper
{
    IEnumerable&lt;string[]&gt; FindAnagramSets(IEnumerable<string> wordList);
}</pre>

  <p>Now, we could create concrete implementations of the interfaces to be used in our tests that return simple dummy results.&#160; An example could look like this:</p>

  <pre class="brush: csharp">public class TestFileParser : IFileParser
{
    public IEnumerable&lt;string&gt; ExtractWordListFromFile(string filePath)
    {
        return new[] { &quot;wordA&quot;, &quot;wordB&quot;, &quot;Aword&quot;, &quot;wordC&quot; };;
    }
}</pre>

  <p>This is helpful because it keeps the one class we are interested in from being dependent on any real logic in its dependencies.&#160; We want to be able to test our modules in isolation from any dependencies, so that no secondary or outside influences skew the test results.&#160; We are basically providing dummy dependencies to our tests that have no logic that could cause side effects.</p>

  <p>However, the software development community has provided tools called mocking frameworks that can create these dependency stubs for you.&#160; This can save you from creating concrete interface implementations that have no use except for in testing.&#160; The mocking framework I will try out is <a href="http://www.ayende.com/projects/rhino-mocks.aspx" target="_blank">Rhino.Mocks from Ayende</a>.&#160; To get set up, you merely need to <a href="http://www.ayende.com/projects/rhino-mocks/downloads.aspx" target="_blank">download the latest build zip archive</a>, extract out the <font face="Courier New">Rhino.Mocks.dll</font> library to our <font face="Courier New">Libraries</font> folder created in the last blog post, and add a reference to the DLL in our Visual Studio solution.&#160; I will next show you how to use Rhino.Mocks as we rewrite our first specification test.</p>
  <a name="firstSpec"></a>

  <h3>Rewrite of Our First Specification/Test</h3>

  <p>Armed with SRP, DIP, mocking, a more strict adherence to the actual problem statement, and a renewed focus on “favoring test driving logic over just testing data,” we now rewrite our first specification as follows:</p>

  <pre class="brush: csharp">[Subject(typeof(AnagramsFinder), &quot;Finding Anagrams&quot;)]
public class when_given_text_file_with_word_on_each_line
{
    static AnagramsFinder sut;
    static IEnumerable&lt;string[]&gt; result;
    static string filePath = &quot;dummy_file_path.txt&quot;;
    static IEnumerable&lt;string&gt; wordListFromFile = new[] { &quot;wordA&quot;, &quot;wordB&quot;, &quot;Aword&quot;, &quot;wordC&quot; };
    static IEnumerable&lt;string[]&gt; expected = new[] { new[] { &quot;anagram&quot;, &quot;gramana&quot; } };

    Establish context = () =&gt;
    {
        var fileParser = MockRepository.GenerateStub&lt;IFileParser&gt;();
        fileParser.Stub(x =&gt; x.ExtractWordListFromFile(filePath)).Return(wordListFromFile);

        var anagramGrouper = MockRepository.GenerateStub&lt;IAnagramGrouper&gt;();
        anagramGrouper.Stub(x =&gt; x.FindAnagramSets(wordListFromFile)).Return(expected);

        sut = new AnagramsFinder(fileParser, anagramGrouper);
    };

    Because of = () =&gt;
    {
        result = sut.ExtractAnagramSets(filePath);
    };

    It should_result_in_list_of_anagram_sets = () =&gt;
    {
        result.ShouldEqual(expected);
    };
}</pre>

  <p>I should mention a few notes about the code.&#160; First, we need to add a using Rhino.Mocks statement at the top of our specification class file.&#160; Second, our <font face="Courier New">AnagramsFinder</font> instance variable named <font face="Courier New">sut</font> stands for the “Subject Under Test,” a mannerism I picked up from David Tchepak, whom I’ve mentioned several times throughout this post series.</p>

  <p>Our use of Rhino.Mocks is found when we call the <font face="Courier New">MockRepository.GenerateStub</font> method against an interface.&#160; We then proceed to tell the stubbed object how to behave by specifying dummy return values when given methods of the object are called with given parameters.&#160; The last line of our “context” setup is to then inject these two newly generated, stubbed dependencies into our manager class for testing.&#160; It’s also interesting to note that none of my parameters and expected outputs really make much sense.&#160; This is done on purpose to show that the data really doesn’t matter to this class, as we are not testing the logic of any data processing by the dependencies (remember, test in isolation).&#160; It is true that this test really isn’t testing any real logic at this point, and it may even never evolve into testing any real logic either.&#160; However, I think the important point is that it aided us in fleshing out the design, which we previously didn’t know how we were going to implement.&#160; Not all tests will created equal in regard to validating our logic, but they all will play a part in driving the design of our code.&#160; Hopefully these statements are true, and I would love to hear feedback on this topic in the comments.</p>

  <p>I also want to touch on the Specification pattern of Behavior Driven Design and testing.&#160; Specification tests are commonly set up into a workflow of context establishing, behavior performing, and results asserting.&#160; The MSpec framework is designed to encourage this test organization.</p>

  <h3>Red, Green, Refactor and MSpec Test Runner Output</h3>

  <p>To make our first test run, we need to create the basic outline of our <font face="Courier New">AnagramsFinder</font> class as outlined in our test.&#160; This includes a constructor that takes our two dependencies and an <font face="Courier New">ExtractAnagramSets</font> method:</p>

  <pre class="brush: csharp">public class AnagramsFinder
{
    private IFileParser fileParser;
    private IAnagramGrouper anagramGrouper;

    public AnagramsFinder(IFileParser fileParser, IAnagramGrouper anagramGrouper)
    {
        this.fileParser = fileParser;
        this.anagramGrouper = anagramGrouper;
    }

    public IEnumerable&lt;string[]&gt; ExtractAnagramSets(string filePath)
    {
        throw new NotImplementedException();
    }
}</pre>

  <p>I am using the ConsoleRunner according to the method described in Rob Conery’s introductory MSpec and BDD post, including output to an HTML report.&#160; After running our specifications, we get the following output:</p>

  <pre style="border-bottom: #cecece 1px solid; border-left: #cecece 1px solid; padding-bottom: 5px; background-color: #fbfbfb; min-height: 40px; padding-left: 5px; width: 567px; padding-right: 5px; height: 239px; border-top: #cecece 1px solid; border-right: #cecece 1px solid; padding-top: 5px"><pre style="background-color: #fbfbfb; margin: 0em; width: 100%; font-family: consolas,&#39;Courier New&#39;,courier,monospace; font-size: 12px">Specs in AnagramCodeKata:

AnagramsFinder Finding Anagrams, when given text file with word on each line
¯ should result in list of anagram sets (FAIL)
System.NotImplementedException: The method or operation is not implemented.
   ... Stack Trace here ...

Contexts: 1, Specifications: 1
  0 passed, 1 failed</pre></pre>

  <p>…and the HTML report:</p>

  <p></p>
  <a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_rps657FzHZ0/SwJYInxVVSI/AAAAAAAAADU/jcI2a8kADCA/s1600-h/htmlReportError%5B3%5D.png"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="htmlReportError" border="0" alt="htmlReportError" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_rps657FzHZ0/SwJYJUz3eMI/AAAAAAAAADY/bBzyAsPXUsw/htmlReportError_thumb%5B1%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="564" height="445" /></a> </a>

  <p>A highly encouraged tenet of Test Driven Development is the practice of “Red, Green, Refactor.”&#160; It is meant to denote the evolution of the results and state of your tests.&#160; You are encouraged to write the test and then do the minimum work necessary to get the code base to compile and run.&#160; You are first running your test in a control state where you know it should fail.&#160; Most test runners will show the color Red in regard to failed tests, and thus the name of the first step.&#160; Your next stage is to implement the code to make the test pass and turn the output color to Green, commonly indicating passing tests.&#160; The Refactor stage is a time to pause and see if any code can be reorganized or simplified.&#160; Then “rinse and repeat as necessary”, an applicable instruction from shampoo bottles.</p>

  <p>To make our test pass, we implement real logic to coordinate the calls into our dependencies, like so:</p>

  <pre class="brush: csharp">public IEnumerable&lt;string[]&gt; ExtractAnagramSets(string filePath)
{
    var wordList = fileParser.ExtractWordListFromFile(filePath);
    return anagramGrouper.FindAnagramSets(wordList);
}</pre>

  <p>…and the successful outputs of our test runner:</p>

  <pre style="border-bottom: #cecece 1px solid; border-left: #cecece 1px solid; padding-bottom: 5px; background-color: #fbfbfb; min-height: 40px; padding-left: 5px; width: 579px; padding-right: 5px; height: 156px; border-top: #cecece 1px solid; border-right: #cecece 1px solid; padding-top: 5px"><pre style="background-color: #fbfbfb; margin: 0em; width: 100%; font-family: consolas,&#39;Courier New&#39;,courier,monospace; font-size: 12px">Specs in AnagramCodeKata:

AnagramsFinder Finding Anagrams, when given text file with word on each line
¯ should result in list of anagram sets

Contexts: 1, Specifications: 1</pre></pre>

  <p>&#160;</p>

  <p><a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_rps657FzHZ0/SwJYJpq8OfI/AAAAAAAAADc/noptZ4ChfGo/s1600-h/htmlReportSuccess%5B3%5D.png"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="htmlReportSuccess" border="0" alt="htmlReportSuccess" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_rps657FzHZ0/SwJYKGw-YWI/AAAAAAAAADg/0aPU7UnGVno/htmlReportSuccess_thumb%5B1%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="583" height="436" /></a> </p>

  <h3>Final Thoughts and Questions</h3>

  <p>So what do you think of the new test?&#160; Are we better able to see the Single Responsibility of the <font face="Courier New">AnagramsFinder</font> manager class?&#160; Are we more inline with solving the actual problem statement?&#160; Your feedback would be much appreciated.</p>

  <p>In the next post, we will begin work on test driving the design and implementation of the dependencies…unless of course I get feedback that I should be focusing on a different area first or that this last rewrite still needs more help.</p>

Yes, this is a good start for a great idea (code kata done slowly).<br /><br />Right now, I&#39;m struggling with the same kata and I have a problem looking at your AnagramsFinder and IAnagramGrouper. The result of both is the same and the tests (apart from setting up a not needed IFileParser for the AnagramsFinder) will be the same too.<br /><br />I think this is because you&#39;re using the pipes and filters-pattern (opposite to David, who combines his both results in &quot;focus on test driving logic&quot;). Testing just the filters should be sufficient here?<br /><br />What you maybe can do is a behavioural test. So, instead of testing with stubs, use mock-objects testing weather the methods were called.<br /><br />What do you think about that?<br /><br />p.s. it&#39;s hard to post a comment here because the word verification-textbox is only accessible when selecting text with the mouse and scrolling down :(</div>

Looks good Mike!<br /><br />I wouldn&#39;t call the previous spec a mistake or &quot;foolish&quot; though. I seen working on simple cases like Count advocated lots of places for doing TDD, I&#39;ve just always struggled with getting from those cases to the main responsibilities of the class.<br /><br />Looking forward to the rest of the series.</div>

Download the code and build it to get the necessary libraries that you need into a <font face="Courier New">Bin</font> folder.&#160; My MSpec libraries are a few months old, as I haven’t upgraded my source since my initial download back then.&#160; I have not set up TestDriven.NET and am not sure it will be necessary for this simple coding exercise.&#160; I am using NUnit for the actual testing framework underneath MSpec; the following article may be of interest to you if you would like to use a newer version of NUnit than what MSpec targets:</p>    <p><a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/howard.dierking/archive/2009/11/08/using-latest-nunit-version-with-mspec.aspx" target="_blank">Using Latest NUnit Version with MSpec</a></p>    <p>MSpec helps you organize your code into Specifications, a core BDD concept.&#160; It is inspired by early BDD testing frameworks like Ruby’s <a href="http://rspec.info/" target="_blank">RSpec</a>.&#160; The syntax and arrangement can be a little odd for a static language like C#, but I think I like the direction it is heading.&#160; Again, the best way to get familiar with the syntax, set up the MSpec Test Runner, and configure HTML reporting output is to read <a href="http://blog.wekeroad.com/blog/make-bdd-your-bff-2" target="_blank">Rob’s introductory post on BDD and MSpec</a>.</p>    <h3>Setting Up the Visual Studio Solution</h3>    <p>Let’s begin by creating a C# console application named <font face="Courier New">AnagramCodeKata</font> targeting .NET Framework 3.5.&#160; The solution name (and solution folder) will be the same.&#160; For our dependencies on MSpec (and NUnit), I have created a physical file system folder named <font face="Courier New">Libraries</font> and made it a sibling folder to the project’s physical folder (same level as the solution file).&#160; That folder contains the following DLL libraries from the <font face="Courier New">Bin</font> folder of the compiled MSpec source code:</p>    <ul>     <li><font face="Courier New">CommandLine.dll</font> </li>      <li><font face="Courier New">Machine.Specifications.ConsoleRunner.exe</font> </li>      <li><font face="Courier New">Machine.Specifications.dll</font> </li>      <li><font face="Courier New">Machine.Specifications.NUnit.dll</font> </li>      <li><font face="Courier New">Machine.Specifications.Reporting.dll</font> </li>      <li><font face="Courier New">nunit.framework.dll</font> </li>   </ul>    <p>Then within our Solution Explorer, we only need to make references to 3 of these libraries (namely <font face="Courier New">Machine.Specifications.dll</font>, <font face="Courier New">Machine.Specifications.NUnit.dll</font>, and <font face="Courier New">nunit.framework.dll</font>).&#160; I have also created two folders within our project in Solution Explorer, naming them <font face="Courier New">Reports</font> and <font face="Courier New">Specifications</font>.&#160; The <font face="Courier New">Reports</font> folder will contain the HTML-generated report of running our tests every time.&#160; The <font face="Courier New">Specifications</font> folder will hold our specifications and tests.&#160; This is what our current Solution Explorer looks like now:</p>    <p><a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_rps657FzHZ0/SvyGOtiALTI/AAAAAAAAADM/Xeygzia8cho/s1600-h/anagramScreenshot%5B6%5D.png"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: block; float: none; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin-left: auto; border-left-width: 0px; margin-right: auto" title="anagramScreenshot" border="0" alt="anagramScreenshot" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_rps657FzHZ0/SvyGO870IZI/AAAAAAAAADQ/lDW6F6bIuhI/anagramScreenshot_thumb%5B4%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="289" height="340" /></a> </p>    <p>Also notice the <font face="Courier New">MSpecRunner </font>button at the top, which I’ve created to execute a custom External Tool that points to <font face="Courier New">Machine.Specifications.ConsoleRunner.exe</font> and passes in the appropriate parameters.&#160; This helpful setup was put forth by Rob Conery in the link to his introductory blog post that I provided above.</p>    <h3>Anagram Problem Statement</h3>    <p>So let’s go ahead and look at the <a href="http://codekata.pragprog.com/2007/01/kata_six_anagra.html">Anagram problem</a> we are trying to solve.&#160; Here’s a quick summary of what we are trying to accomplish:</p>    <blockquote>     <p>“The challenge is fairly simple: given a file containing one word per line, print out all the combinations of words that are anagrams; each line in the output contains all the words from the input that are anagrams of each other.”</p>   </blockquote>    <p>Unfortunately, Dave Thomas’ <font face="Courier New">wordlist.txt</font> link is broken on his blog post, and when responding to commenters asking for a fixed link to the text file, he pointed us all to some website that aggregates links to several word lists from around the Web.&#160; Many of us readers wanted to know the exact word list file he used so that we could compare our results to his.&#160; In his post, he states that there should be 2,530 sets of anagrams and 5,680 total words participating in those anagram sets.&#160; The tough part about this is that we’ve got to have the same word list text file.&#160; I searched the web and found a few, but I only found one that might be the same list.&#160; It is from some guy’s personal GitHub repository:</p>    <p><a title="http://github.com/krist0ff/code_kata/tree/ba975c3a64f11a81db2f3716b40de046f1ca7ef4/kata6" href="http://github.com/krist0ff/code_kata/tree/ba975c3a64f11a81db2f3716b40de046f1ca7ef4/kata6">http://github.com/krist0ff/code_kata/tree/ba975c3a64f11a81db2f3716b40de046f1ca7ef4/kata6</a></p>    <p>If you’re visiting this blog post, months or years after it was originally written, I obviously can’t guarantee this file will still be out there.&#160; You can try emailing me or commenting here and I can hopefully send it to you via email if I still have it.&#160; But more importantly, as we progress with this series, we’ll find out if it’s even the right word list or not.</p>    <p>Lastly, I’d like to look at the objectives for the coding kata that Dave Thomas outlines:</p>    <blockquote>     <p>“Apart from having some fun with words, this kata should make you think somewhat about algorithms. The simplest algorithms to find all the anagram combinations may take inordinate amounts of time to do the job. Working though alternatives should help bring the time down by orders of magnitude. To give you a possible point of comparison, I hacked a solution together in 25 lines of Ruby. It runs on the word list from my web site in 1.5s on a 1GHz PPC. It’s also an interesting exercise in testing: can you write unit tests to verify that your code is working correctly before setting it to work on the full dictionary.”</p>   </blockquote>    <p>I don’t think we’ll focus on runtime as much, but we’ll certainly revisit our algorithm as necessary if we have unacceptable wait times for the code to finish.&#160; To complete this section, let’s go ahead and add the <font face="Courier New">wordlist.txt</font> to our solution at the root of of our Project node.</p>    <h3>How About Some Actual Code?!</h3>    <p>So let’s now start off by creating our first specification.&#160; I have created a new C# file named <font face="Courier New">AnagramsFinderSpecs.cs</font> under our <font face="Courier New">Specifications</font> folder in our solution.&#160; I attempted to write our first test, but already feel like I’m not inline with “<a href="http://www.davesquared.net/2009/11/favour-test-driving-logic-over-data.html">favoring test driving logic over just testing data</a>.”</p>    <pre class="brush: csharp">using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;

using Machine.Specifications;

namespace AnagramCodeKata.Specifications
{
    [Subject(typeof(AnagramsFinder), &quot;Finding Anagrams&quot;)]
    public class when_given_text_file_with_word_on_each_line
    {
        static int result;
        static AnagramsFinder sut;

        Establish context = () =&gt;
        {
            sut = new AnagramsFinder();
        };

        Because of = () =&gt;
        {
            result = sut.ParseTextFile(&quot;wordslist.txt&quot;);
        };

        It should_result_in_count_of_2530_anagram_sets = () =&gt;
        {
            result.ShouldEqual(2530);
        };
    }
}</pre>

  <p>If you can’t make out the funky structure and syntax, again refer back to Rob Conery’s introductory post to all of this stuff that I link to at the top.&#160; He does a great job of explaining what’s going on here.</p>

  <p>Also, please remember that I have no clue what I’m doing and I’m just trying to copy people who know what they are doing.&#160; I am hoping that I’ll be corrected by those who have a better idea of how to approach all of this.&#160; This is a good stopping point because of my desire for feedback and the feeling of uncertainty I’m already getting.</p>

  <p>Seriously, please guide me in the right direction or validate where I’m headed, because even I’m not sure where that is yet.&#160; I will say this, I’m pretty sure I shouldn’t be reading in <font face="Courier New">wordslist.txt</font> yet, and that this might be where I need to start using a mocking framework.</p>

  <p>Stay tuned, there’s more to come.&#160; I just can’t tell what it will be about yet.&#160; It’ll still be fun though, I promise.</p>

Yes, thank you.  You&#39;ve given me some clairty now and some great ideas that I&#39;ll try implementing over the weekend.</div>

Hi Mike,<br /><br />Like you, I&#39;m a bit wary of that first spec you&#39;ve written (that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s wrong obviously &#8211; I&#39;m new to this too :)). <br /><br />You&#39;re right that you are testing data &#8211; loading the wordslist.txt file and checking for the right number of anagram combinations. By the way, this is probably a good example of an integration test for when you are done! :)<br /><br />Whenever I have a hard problem like this that I am having trouble solving, I try and cheat. If you keep this class simple, but push the tricky bits lower down the heirarchy then that may help you start.<br /><br />Here&#39;s how I would update the current spec to help implement your test (this won&#39;t be a spoiler because I&#39;d change the test. I&#39;ll go into that later). <br /><br />In this case I can think of two responsibilities: getting the words from our file, and then counting the number of anagrams found in those words. So maybe your spec&#39;s context could stub out a IFileReader or similar which will return an IEnumerable&lt;string&gt; (filled with some fake data) when asked to get the lines in wordslist.txt. You could then give these words to an IAnagramCounter, which will return 2530.<br /><br />Your test and because can remain the same &#8211; only the context will change (which is what I love about this style of writing specs).<br /><br />Of course this isn&#39;t specifying what your AnagramFinder should actually do&#8230; the kata aim is to print all the anagram combinations to the screen. So you may be better off trying this approach of pushing down logic but rewrite the spec to match the exact problem you are trying to solve.<br /><br />I&#39;m not sure if this will help or lead you down a dead end, but it is the approach I would take.<br /><br />Hope it helps!<br />David</div>

<p>At work, we have a line of desktop products for one of clients installed on the user’s Windows machine via MSI installers.&#160; We use Visual Studio Setup Projects to create the MSI installers.&#160; Visual Studio also provides the ability to create setup bootstrappers to make sure the user has all the prerequisites needed for the MSI install technology and any dependencies required by your desktop product.&#160; These bootstrappers are unmanaged code, because you can’t always depend on the .NET framework already being there (at least not until everyone is off of XP and lower).&#160; I have developed a solution that has worked for the last year or more, but has felt clumsy and slapped together.&#160; Recently I found the <a href="http://dotnetinstaller.codeplex.com/">open source project called dotNetInstaller</a> which has better provided me with the control and flexibility I need for custom logic during bootstrap and install time.&#160; I’ll first introduce you to my “hack” solution.</p> <span class="fullpost">   <p>It has been difficult for me to find ways to tie into the bootstrapper logic workflow to add in custom logic during installs, and Visual Studio is very rigid in its flexibility and basic in its configuration options in this regard.&#160; Until recently, I had settled on writing managed, C# code for this custom logic meant to run before or after the MSI installer, and then creating another unmanaged <font face="Courier New">setup.exe</font> bootstrapper to ensure the .NET framework was installed just so that executable could run.&#160; So the user would run this new unmanaged <font face="Courier New">setup.exe</font> bootstrapper (making sure .NET framework was installed), which would then call my managed custom logic executable, which would then call the MSI installer’s unmanaged, Visual Studio-generated <font face="Courier New">setup.exe</font> bootstrapper (ensuring more prerequisites were installed), which would then finally install the MSI, and which would then lastly return to my managed custom logic executable for any post-install, clean up logic.&#160; I describe this solution in full (and how to generate the same bootstrappers that Visual Studio creates using MSBuild outside the IDE) in a StackOverflow.com answer that I submitted:</p>    <p><a title="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1106768/how-can-i-reverse-engineer-an-installer-that-was-written-with-ghost-installer/1121846#1121846" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1106768/how-can-i-reverse-engineer-an-installer-that-was-written-with-ghost-installer/1121846#1121846">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1106768/how-can-i-reverse-engineer-an-installer-that-was-written-with-ghost-installer/1121846#1121846</a></p>    <p>Well, recently I found the <a href="http://dotnetinstaller.codeplex.com/">dotNetInstaller project on CodePlex.com</a> and have found it to be the control and flexibility I need for custom logic when bootstrapping installers.&#160; Not only does it give you great control over prerequisite install order, it also gives you the ability to run code after MSI install and to also filter on CPU architecture types, OS versions, and other registry or file system conditions.&#160; I have currently setup branching scenarios for the prerequisites based on if the user has a 32-bit (x86) or 64-bit (x64) OS.&#160; This utility will even let you brand the bootstrapper with a banner and icon, which is a change of pace from the plain and unlabeled bootstrapper that Visual Studio and MSBuild produce.</p>    <p>If you have custom bootstrapping needs, I have to highly recommend you give dotNetInstaller a look.&#160; Hopefully it will prove as flexible and powerful for your needs as it has for mine.</p> </span>  </div>

<p>Many forms of martial arts utilize the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata" target="_blank">kata</a> as a means for detailed, focused practice and training.&#160; The power of this practice comes from repetition and focus on simple fundamentals, “while attempting to maintain perfect form.”&#160; The principle goal is to “try out different combinations of techniques in a safe, practice environment to ultimately find out how to defeat your opponent”.&#160; In the last few years, this concept has taken hold within the software development world in the form of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_Kata" target="_blank">Code Kata</a>, a phrase coined by <a href="http://pragprog.com/" target="_blank">Pragmatic Programmer</a> <a href="http://pragdave.pragprog.com/" target="_blank">Dave Thomas</a> (and <a href="http://codekata.pragprog.com/" target="_blank">here is his blog dedicated to the Code Kata</a>).</p>  <p>My inspiration for all of this is <a href="http://www.davesquared.net/2009/10/calculators-and-tale-of-two-tdds-pt-1.html" target="_blank">David Tchepak’s Calculator Kata series of posts</a>.&#160; Hopefully he will stop by and provide some helpful guidance and advice.&#160; I have selected the <a href="http://codekata.pragprog.com/2007/01/kata_six_anagra.html" target="_blank">Anagram Kata (code kata number 6)</a> for me to practice.&#160; My goals for this series of posts are:</p>  <ul>   <li>To practice coding and share my learning experience with you, while also soliciting feedback and suggestions. </li>    <li>To more fully understand the concepts driving <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_Driven_Development" target="_blank">Behavior Driven Development (BDD)</a> via a testing framework designed for such a practice, namely <a href="http://blog.wekeroad.com/blog/make-bdd-your-bff-2/" target="_blank">MSpec</a>. </li>    <li>To keep to the <a href="http://www.davesquared.net/2009/01/introduction-to-solid-principles-of-oo.html" target="_blank">SOLID principles of Object-Oriented Design</a>, especially <a href="http://www.davesquared.net/2009/11/favour-test-driving-logic-over-data.html" target="_blank">in favor of test driving logic over just testing data</a>. </li> </ul>  <p>Below I will keep an updated list of blog posts in this series.&#160; Hope you enjoy it!</p>  <ul>   <li><a href="http://murrayon.net/2009/11/anagram-code-kata-part-1-getting.html">Part 1 – Getting Started</a> </li>    <li><a href="http://murrayon.net/2009/11/anagram-code-kata-part-2-mocking-and.html" target="_blank">Part 2 – Mocking and SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)</a> </li>    <li><a href="http://murrayon.net/2009/12/anagram-code-kata-part-3-use-common.html" target="_blank">Part 3 – Use Common Sense</a> </li>    <li><a href="http://murrayon.net/2010/01/anagram-code-kata-part-4-will-it-write.html">Part 4 – Will it Write My Code for Me?</a></li>    <li><a href="http://murrayon.net/2010/02/anagram-code-kata-part-5-domain-objects.html">Part 5 – Domain Objects Over Language Primitives</a>&#160;</li> </ul>  <p><strong><u>UPDATE (07/18/10)</u></strong>:&#160; I was asked where the source code to this post series could be found.&#160; I decided to host it at BitBucket.org using Mercurial for the source control:&#160; <a href="http://bitbucket.org/murrayondotnet/anagramkata/">http://bitbucket.org/murrayondotnet/anagramkata/</a></p></div>
