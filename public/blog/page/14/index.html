<p>A cool new technology Microsoft is working on in its Live Labs is called Volta.&#160; It is a way to develop web applications all in one tier, and then late in the development process decide which parts of the code should be client-side and which parts should be server side.&#160; The idea is that you can easily move code fragments back and forth between client-side and server-side at will.&#160; You write your web application in any language of your choice that compiles to .NET and Volta will turn it completely and solely into HTML and JavaScript, meaning your resulting site will be compatible with any browser.&#160; And your site can have all of this with an AJAX look-and-feel.&#160; Check it out here:&#160; <a title="http://labs.live.com/volta/" href="http://labs.live.com/volta/">http://labs.live.com/volta/</a></p>  <p>A different Microsoft team is working on a download called ASP.NET 3.5 Extensions (<a title="http://www.asp.net/downloads/3.5-extensions/" href="http://www.asp.net/downloads/3.5-extensions/">http://www.asp.net/downloads/3.5-extensions/</a>).&#160; It is in &quot;public preview&quot; right now.&#160; It contains some new additions to ASP.NET AJAX, some new Silverlight controls, and a few other cool additions.&#160; Most interesting to me is an MVC Framework&#160; (Model-View-Controller).&#160; One of the managers has a blog that I frequent, and he has written a 5-part series of blogs about this new framework.&#160; This link will send you directly to Part 1 (skipping Part 0):&#160; <a title="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/11/13/asp-net-mvc-framework-part-1.aspx" href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/11/13/asp-net-mvc-framework-part-1.aspx">http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/11/13/asp-net-mvc-framework-part-1.aspx</a></p>  <p>Also, it appears Microsoft recently released a training kit for Visual Studio 2008 and .NET Framework 3.5 available for download now at the following location:&#160; <a title="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=8bdaa836-0bba-4393-94db-6c3c4a0c98a1&amp;DisplayLang=en" href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=8bdaa836-0bba-4393-94db-6c3c4a0c98a1&amp;DisplayLang=en">http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=8bdaa836-0bba-4393-94db-6c3c4a0c98a1&amp;DisplayLang=en</a></p>  <p>Enjoy.</p>  </div>

<p>I have a Visual Studio 2005 deployment project where I wanted to add a launch condition that would check the registry for a key before continuing.&#160; This article is really straight forward about how to do that:&#160; <a title="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/4awx1f1d(VS.80).aspx" href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/4awx1f1d(VS.80).aspx">http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/4awx1f1d(VS.80).aspx</a></p>  <p>However, every time I put the registry path in, it would never find the key upon install.&#160; So the key was located at something like <font face="Courier New">HKLM\SOFTWARE\MyCompany\MyProduct</font> and then there was a Value named <font face="Courier New">Target Path</font> that I wanted to check if it existed.&#160; My understanding (and perhaps I&#8217;m wrong) that keys are keys but the values are keys also (at least it seems that way when doing registry stuff through the .NET APIs in C#).&#160; So when I saw the following statement in the above article, I thought the property was for testing the value of a <font face="Courier New">Value</font> (AKA key?):</p>  <blockquote>   <p><font face="Courier New">&quot;Optionally, set the <strong><u>Value</u></strong> property to search for a specific value in the registry key.&quot;</font></p> </blockquote>  <p>Essentially I tried to append the <font face="Courier New">Value</font> to the <font face="Courier New">RegKey</font> path, because I thought the <font face="Courier New">Value</font> property was only for testing the value of the <font face="Courier New">Value</font>.&#160; If you want to test the value of the <font face="Courier New">Value</font>, you do it in the <font face="Courier New">Condition</font> property of the <font face="Courier New">Property</font> created by the registry launch condition.&#160; Is that as clear as mud? </p>  <p>This article is what cleared up my confusion (the 2nd post, the one by Phil Wilson):&#160; <a title="http://www.dotnet247.com/247reference/msgs/49/246890.aspx" href="http://www.dotnet247.com/247reference/msgs/49/246890.aspx">http://www.dotnet247.com/247reference/msgs/49/246890.aspx</a> </p>  <p>I realized that a registry <font face="Courier New">Value</font> should not be part of the <font face="Courier New">RegKey</font> path.</p>  </div>

<p>So I&#8217;m really excited to start using Visual Studio 2008 and LINQ.&#160; A few of the guys here at work are learning it and will hopefully be giving us a little presentation in the next few weeks about how they used it in one of our projects.&#160; They have been learning it with the help of the following tutorial, which I hope to read through in the next few days:&#160; <a title="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/05/19/using-linq-to-sql-part-1.aspx" href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/05/19/using-linq-to-sql-part-1.aspx">http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/05/19/using-linq-to-sql-part-1.aspx</a></p>  <p>By the way, it&#8217;s a 9-part series of blog posts (if you care to get that into it).</p>  </div>

<p>I fixed a UI issue we were having where some work was being done and it was updating a progress bar, but it wasn&#8217;t correctly painting the rest of the labels and other static UI elements.&#160; It&#8217;s best to let the UI do it&#8217;s thing on the main thread, and then spawn off a worker thread in the background, allowing them to communicate with each other through delegates.</p> <span class='fullpost'> <p>Here is a very nicely done, informative article about delegates that I should have read (I probably would have gotten to my solution quicker and surpassed my trial and error issues):&#160; <a title="http://www.ondotnet.com/pub/a/dotnet/2002/11/04/delegates.htm" href="http://www.ondotnet.com/pub/a/dotnet/2002/11/04/delegates.htm">http://www.ondotnet.com/pub/a/dotnet/2002/11/04/delegates.htm</a></p>  <p>I used the following two articles as a basis for my fix:</p>  <ul>   <li><a title="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms951089.aspx" href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms951089.aspx">http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms951089.aspx</a> </li>    <li><a title="http://www.ondotnet.com/pub/a/dotnet/2003/02/24/asyncdelegates.html?page=1" href="http://www.ondotnet.com/pub/a/dotnet/2003/02/24/asyncdelegates.html?page=1">http://www.ondotnet.com/pub/a/dotnet/2003/02/24/asyncdelegates.html?page=1</a> </li> </ul>  <p>However, I didn&#8217;t end up using the <font face="Courier New">MulticastDelegate</font> class at all in my solution.&#160; It&#8217;s not really necessary, and I couldn&#8217;t get it to work when I tried to extend or inherit from it.&#160; The following article says you can&#8217;t anyway, unless you are a compiler or some similar tool:&#160; <a title="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.multicastdelegate.aspx" href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.multicastdelegate.aspx">http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.multicastdelegate.aspx</a></p>  <p>This link has a cool helper class for asynchronous delegates, though I didn&#8217;t use it:&#160; <a title="http://peach.ease.lsoft.com/scripts/wa.exe?A2=ind0302B&amp;L=ADVANCED-DOTNET&amp;T=0&amp;F=&amp;S=&amp;P=31992" href="http://peach.ease.lsoft.com/scripts/wa.exe?A2=ind0302B&amp;L=ADVANCED-DOTNET&amp;T=0&amp;F=&amp;S=&amp;P=31992">http://peach.ease.lsoft.com/scripts/wa.exe?A2=ind0302B&amp;L=ADVANCED-DOTNET&amp;T=0&amp;F=&amp;S=&amp;P=31992</a></p>  <p>Good luck.</p>  <p><strong><u>FOLLOWUP (05/21/09)</u>:&#160; </strong>I have some further clarifications about how to properly invoke delegates to a new background thread in this post:</p>  <p><a href="http://murrayon.net/2009/05/begininvoke-methods-and-oneway.html">BeginInvoke Methods and OneWay Attribute</a></p> </span>  </div>

<p>So after being able to successfully build that large deployment project I was talking about by <a title="Building a Monster VS 2005 (or 2008) Deployment Project" href="http://murrayon.net/2007/12/building-monster-vs-2005-or-2008.html">using the 3GB switch</a>, a day or two later I began getting an &quot;<font face="Courier New">Unrecoverable build error</font>&quot; message accompanied with a &quot;<font face="Courier New">Send Error Report</font>&quot; dialog.&#160; It didn&#8217;t kill the IDE process, but did stop the installer build.&#160; I verified that I was able to build other deployment and non-deployment projects without any problems.</p> <span class='fullpost'> <p>So after searching around, I tried a few solutions people said helped them solve the problem.&#160; Some of the simple and straight forward ones I tried were simply restarting the IDE and doing a clean on the solution; I even resorted to a machine reboot.&#160; I next tried all of the applicable solutions from this Microsoft article:&#160; <a title="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/329214" href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/329214">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/329214</a> (or this one says the same thing basically:&#160; <a title="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms228633(VS.80).aspx" href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms228633(VS.80).aspx">http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms228633(VS.80).aspx</a>).&#160; I also found another guy that said to try doing a <font face="Courier New">regsvr32</font> on <font face="Courier New">ole32.dll</font>.&#160; By the way, here is the typical location of <font face="Courier New">mergemod.dll</font>:&#160; <font face="Courier New">C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\MSI Tools\</font> and here is the typical location of <font face="Courier New">ole32.dll</font>:&#160; <font face="Courier New">C:\WINDOWS\System32\</font>.</p>  <p>None of it seemed to help my situation.&#160; So I tried uninstalling Visual Studio, and then uninstalling all versions of the .NET Framework with the help of this handy tool:&#160; <a title="http://blogs.msdn.com/astebner/archive/2006/05/30/611355.aspx" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/astebner/archive/2006/05/30/611355.aspx">http://blogs.msdn.com/astebner/archive/2006/05/30/611355.aspx</a>.Then I went ahead and reinstalled everything and gave it a nice machine reboot.&#160; Even this charade proved unsuccessful.</p>  <p>The good news in all of this was that I am still currently the only developer that cannot build this deployment project.&#160; So it is definitely something with my machine that is the problem and not with the actual deployment project itself (we were concerned for a little while about the &quot;multiple folders with the same name&quot; issue mentioned in the Microsoft articles).</p>  <p>So when I get time, I may try to do an OS reinstall and be extra careful of what and when stuff gets installed.&#160; Luckily I have got my personal files on a separate partition, so only the system partition will have to be blown away.&#160; If this proves successful, which it should, I will make an additional note to this post.&#160; Good luck if you ever get this same problem.</p>  <p><strong><u>FOLLOWUP (01/18/08)</u></strong>:&#160; So it turns out that my computer actually crashed a few days later.&#160; When I formatted my hard drive and did a fresh install of Windows, everything seemed to be fine again so I didn&#8217;t question the hardware anymore.&#160; Then I turned on the <font face="Courier New">3GB</font> Windows switch for Windows and everything went haywire.&#160; I removed 2 of my 4 GB of RAM and then everything was fine.&#160; I tried all kinds of combinations with different memory sticks in different memory slots with different totals of RAM.&#160; It seemed I could only run in <font face="Courier New">3GB</font> Windows mode with 2 GB of RAM; however, in normal Windows mode, I could successfully run with all 4 GB of RAM.&#160; So I opted for the 4 GB and will continue to allow someone else to build the monster deployment project, which he has been able to do every time without any issues using the <font face="Courier New">3GB</font> Windows switch.</p>  <p><u><strong>FOLLOWUP (06/17/08)</strong></u>:&#160; For the last 6 months, I have tried two or three times to get another machine to build these installers using the <font face="Courier New">3GB</font> Windows boot switch and modifying the <font face="Courier New">DevEnv.exe</font> executable to be &quot;<font face="Courier New">Large Address Aware</font>&quot;; all of my attempts have been unsuccessful.&#160; Currently, we only have one guy&#8217;s laptop that can handle the build and is running stable with the <font face="Courier New">3GB</font> switch (and we have no clue why it works).&#160; He has been using a local account on his machine for like 9 months and he just recently switched to a domain account.&#160; The interesting thing is that we could no longer build the installers anymore.&#160; But when we went back to using a regular local account (not on the domain), his laptop was able to build the installers again.&#160; With that knowledge, I just now tried building the installers on my machine using a local account; unfortunately, it was unsuccessful.&#160; However, I also don&#8217;t have the <font face="Courier New">3GB</font> switch turned on.&#160; Perhaps the combination of the two is why his laptop is able to build the installers.&#160; I may finish this test of my hypothesis soon, but not right now.</p>  <p><strong><u>FOLLOWUP (06/18/08)</u></strong>:&#160; <strong>I got it working!!!</strong>&#160; The problem was being logged in with a domain user account for some reason.&#160; I am really not sure why; there must be something different about using a domain user account (perhaps during the login process or some restriction set on our domain user accounts or policies).&#160; I did test it without the changes involving the <font face="Courier New">3GB</font> switch, but they are necessary as well.&#160; In fact in my setup, I also didn&#8217;t put the box on the domain at all, just to be sure.&#160; The box runs very stable as far as I can tell with these modifications to Windows and the Visual Studio executable.</p> </span>  </div>
