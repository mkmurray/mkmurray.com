<p>I&#8217;ve been following <a title="Rob Conery&#39;s Blog" href="http://blog.wekeroad.com/">Rob Conery&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://blog.wekeroad.com/mvc-storefront/mvc-storefront-part-1/">ASP.NET MVC Storefront project</a> that he has been broadcasting to the world via webcasts.&#160; This project has been going on for over 6 months now and there are currently over 20 videos to watch if you really want to get up fully up to speed (which will literally take days).</p>  <p>Anyway, it&#8217;s a Storefront website application built on technologies such as <a href="http://netfx3.com/content/WFHome.aspx">Windows Workflow</a>, <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/10/14/asp-net-mvc-framework.aspx">ASP.NET MVC</a>, <a href="http://netfx3.com/content/WindowsCardspaceHome.aspx">CardSpace</a>, <a href="http://structuremap.sourceforge.net/Default.htm">StructureMap</a>, <a href="https://www.paypal.com/IntegrationCenter/ic_standard_home.html">PayPal Standard</a>, <a href="http://openid.net/">OpenID</a>, and many others.&#160; While slowly connecting all of these technologies together, Rob attempts to really learn <a title="Test Driven Development" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">TDD</a> at the same time.&#160; He&#8217;s an employee of Microsoft.</p>  <p>One of the things that I really like that he did was to modify the <a href="http://www.devx.com/dotnet/Article/33695/0/page/5">Repository Pattern</a> slightly by adding in <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms978599.aspx">Pipes and Filters Pattern</a> on top of it using the <font face="Courier New">IQueryable&lt;&gt;</font> generic in LINQ.&#160; It really is brilliant in my opinion, and if you want to get totally up to speed with just this small part of his project, watch the first 3-5 videos of Rob&#8217;s Storefront project.&#160; Then read a blog post by him about an issue he ran into and how he fixed it; the link to his post is at the bottom of this blog entry.</p> <span class='fullpost'> <p>In the process of making this new Repository pattern, he came across some issues with trying to do true Lazy Loading of an object&#8217;s relationships to other objects within his LINQ queries.&#160; Basically he wanted to harness the power of <font face="Courier New">IQueryable</font> used by LINQ queries to create the expression that queries against the database but not execute it unless needed.&#160; For instance, if you&#8217;ve got a <font face="Courier New">Product</font> object in your model and it contains a collection of <font face="Courier New">UserRating</font> objects, there will be times when you want to retrieve a <font face="Courier New">Product</font> with its <font face="Courier New">UserRatings</font> and times when you only need the <font face="Courier New">Product</font>.&#160; The most efficient way to do it (and coolest) would be to retrieve the object and its relationships the same way every time and let the <font face="Courier New">IQueryable</font> magic of LINQ know when to execute the query against the database and when to leave it as an unexecuted expression.</p>  <p>So Rob created the <font face="Courier New">LazyList</font> object that holds the <font face="Courier New">IQueryable</font> expression until you need to iterate over it or retrieve one of its elements, where it executes the query and fetches real data from the data source.&#160; Rob ran into some unexpected issues with the relationships not loading lazily but was able to solve the problem by using the keyword <font face="Courier New" color="#333333"><a title="LINQ Keyword: " let"" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb383976.aspx">let</a></font> in LINQ.&#160; Read his full post about the issues and fixes (and get the source code for the <font face="Courier New">LazyList</font> class) at the following link:</p>  <p><a title="http://blog.wekeroad.com/blog/lazy-loading-with-the-lazylist/" href="http://blog.wekeroad.com/blog/lazy-loading-with-the-lazylist/">http://blog.wekeroad.com/blog/lazy-loading-with-the-lazylist/</a></p> </span>  </div>

Hi Mike,<br /><br />I really enjoyed Rob&#39;s series too. I&#39;ve been out of data-centric apps for a little while so I haven&#39;t really had a chance to play around with these ideas.<br /><br />One thing I have been following with interest is the DDD approach to this. I&#39;d really recommend having a read of some of <a href="http://www.udidahan.com/2009/06/29/dont-create-aggregate-roots/" rel="nofollow">Udi Dahan&#39;s posts</a>, as well as <a href="http://herdingcode.com/?p=189" rel="nofollow">Greg Young&#39;s recent appearance on Herding Code</a>. This stuff has really challenged my previous ideas on how operations like &quot;loading a Product&quot; should be approached.</div>

<p>A while back, I went on a research binge about LINQ and Lambda Expressions in C# 3.0.&#160; In my research I also learned about the amazing <font face="Courier New">IQueryable&lt;&gt;</font> generic.&#160; I was just recently reminded of this knowledge surge and figured it could probably benefit many people.</p>  <p>So here are some links I think you just might find as interesting as I do:</p>  <ul>   <li><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/howard_dierking/archive/2007/01/18/lambda-lambda-lambda.aspx">Lambda, Lambda, Lambda</a></li>    <li><a href="http://blog.wekeroad.com/blog/linq-understanding-linq-vars-and-lambdas/">LINQ: Understanding LINQ Vars and Lambdas</a></li>    <li><a href="http://blog.wekeroad.com/blog/creating-in-queries-with-linq-to-sql/">Creating IN Queries with LINQ-to-SQL</a></li>    <li><a href="http://blog.wekeroad.com/blog/linq-gymnastics-creating-a-predictive-query-with-linq/">LINQ Gymnastics: Creating a Predictive Query with LINQ</a></li> </ul>  </div>

<p>I attended an <a href="https://msevents.microsoft.com/CUI/EventDetail.aspx?culture=en-US&amp;eventid=1032390917&amp;flag=3">MSDN Unleashed Event here in Salt Lake City yesterday</a> based mostly on the new bells and whistles in .NET 3.5 SP1 (and consequently Visual Studio 2008 SP1).&#160; I always enjoy the presentations from <a title="Rob Bagby&#39;s Blog" href="http://www.robbagby.com/">Rob Bagby</a>, as he is entertaining to listen to and he is a let&#8217;s-dive-into-the-code, forget-about-Powerpoint-slides kind of presenter.&#160; He is a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/bb905078.aspx">Microsoft Developer Evangelist (click Role Descriptions on the right column of the page this link references)</a> for the Rocky Mountain states inland from the Pacific Coast.&#160; That&#8217;s just the way he rolls.</p>  <p>Anyway, he was trying to add some functionality to <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/12/14/new-asp-net-dynamic-data-support.aspx">ASP.NET Dynamic Data</a> for a demo he was showing during the event, and he mentioned a conversation he had with some of the developers at Redmond about the possibility of partial Properties.&#160; According to his words, the impression he got was that &quot;if partial Properties were added to C#, the whole CLR would catch fire&quot; or some other horrible catastrophe.&#160; But Rob did mention the little-known existence of partial Methods in C# 3.0, which caught my attention and sent me surfing.</p>  <p>See <a title="C# Partial Classes Can Enhance Code Organization" href="http://murrayon.net/2008/10/c-partial-classes-can-enhance-code.html">my last post about partial Classes</a> if you want some background to partial Methods.</p>  <p>The genesis of this new feature is much the same as that of partial Classes, which is primarily for Classes that are auto-generated by code generators in Visual Studio (mainly associated with the numerous designers incorporated into Visual Studio).&#160; In fact, it appears the addition of LINQ may be one reason for this new feature.</p> <span class='fullpost'> <p>Partial Methods seem to be a way to incorporate into your Classes methods that may or may not be implemented, kind of a way to stub out areas where another developer could inject specific logic they require into a pipeline of statements they didn&#8217;t write.&#160; Partial Methods can only reside in partial Classes, and can only have one declaration and up to one optional implementation.&#160; They must be <font face="Courier New">private</font>, have a <font face="Courier New">void</font> return value, and there are quite a few modifiers that cannot be used on a partial method.&#160; For a more comprehensive detailing of these restrictions (and explanations why), see this blog post by <a title="Bart De Smet&#39;s Blog" href="http://community.bartdesmet.net/blogs/bart/default.aspx">Bart De Smet</a> that I read to learn about this new feature:</p>  <p><a title="http://community.bartdesmet.net/blogs/bart/archive/2007/07/28/c-3-0-partial-methods-what-why-and-how.aspx" href="http://community.bartdesmet.net/blogs/bart/archive/2007/07/28/c-3-0-partial-methods-what-why-and-how.aspx">http://community.bartdesmet.net/blogs/bart/archive/2007/07/28/c-3-0-partial-methods-what-why-and-how.aspx</a></p>  <p>Apparently, LINQ-to-SQL makes use of this new language feature to allow the developer to plug their own business logic validation rules without modifying the auto-generated code directly.&#160; If you go to a LINQ-to-SQL generated Class, you will find a C# <font face="Courier New">region</font> named &quot;<font face="Courier New">Extensibility Method Definitions</font>,&quot; which are partial Method declarations (see first image below).&#160; This allows you to make a separate file that is a partial Class of the LINQ-to-SQL generated class and include an implementation for one of these partial Methods, which are by default unimplemented.&#160; It appears LINQ-to-SQL allows you to plug into some of the setters of the generated object Properties that map to columns in the original SQL database table.&#160; The following images are taken from Bart&#8217;s blog post and are LINQ-to-SQL generated objects based on some of the DB structure for <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts2008/products/bb933758.aspx">Team Foundation Server</a>:</p>  <p>Here are some partial Method declarations in a LINQ-to-SQL generated Class called <font face="Courier New">BuildCoverage</font>:</p>  <p><img src="http://www.bartdesmet.net/images/C3.0partialmethodsWhatwhyandhow_CE94/image_12.png" /></p>  <p>And here is the view of the LINQ-to-SQL generated object in the designer so you can see that most of these partial Methods are based on the object&#8217;s Properties:</p>  <p><img src="http://www.bartdesmet.net/images/C3.0partialmethodsWhatwhyandhow_CE94/image_11.png" /></p>  <p>Here is a look at a Property setter calling these unimplemented partial Methods:</p>  <p><img height="300" alt="" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/charliebrown928/SQJBYPObp4I/AAAAAAAAACI/AMWxncxDMH4/image%5B6%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="426" /> </p>  <p>And if you wanted to implement one of these partial Methods, you get nice intellisense from Visual Studio:</p>  <p><img height="390" alt="" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/charliebrown928/SQJBYU4Ki7I/AAAAAAAAACM/sG09khAFfKY/image%5B14%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="431" /> </p>  <p>And I suppose this finished implementation of the partial Method would throw a <font face="Courier New">NotImplementedException</font> after the Property has already been modified? Hopefully this is where some of that LINQ-to-SQL transactional stuff kicks in&#8230;or perhaps Bart meant to implement the <font face="Courier New">OnAssemblyNameChanging</font> partial Method instead?</p>  <p><img height="313" alt="" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/charliebrown928/SQJBYpve4lI/AAAAAAAAACQ/PsaT9nM4x6k/image%5B20%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="436" /> </p>  <p>This is definitely an interesting new feature in the C# language.&#160; I&#8217;ll have to keep my eye out for a really compelling use of this feature; I&#8217;m not very convinced this is the right way (or even the most common way) for using LINQ-to-SQL generated objects as if they were your Data Model objects and then insert your business logic in the above manner.&#160; Still, this is quite a thought provoking new feature.</p> </span>  </div>

Intersting stuff. I really like the idea of giving other people hooks into your code; I&#8217;m not sure partial methods are the best way to accomplish that.</div>

<p>Many .NET developers are aware of the idea of partial Classes, as they have existed since .NET 2.0.&#160; The primary purpose is to allow you the developer to share claim on a C# Class with Visual Studio&#8217;s automated code generators (mainly used by the many designers included in Visual Studio), without the automated code generator stomping all over your code additions every time it runs.&#160; For instance, in a Windows Forms application, you get a code-behind Class where you can put your logic, properties, methods, and event handlers; it is a partial Class of the one Visual Studio&#8217;s Windows Form designer creates and manages for all the UI objects you dragged around in the designer.&#160; A good summarization of this feature is given by <a title="Bart De Smet&#39;s Blog" href="http://community.bartdesmet.net/blogs/bart/default.aspx">Bart De Smet</a>:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>&quot;In short, partial classes allow you to split the definition of a class across multiple files, or alternatively you could think about it as a code compilation unit separated over multiple files.&quot;</p> </blockquote>  <p>As another practical application of this feature, I have occasionally implemented a practice using partial Classes that I learned from a previous coworker.&#160; Occasionally you find yourself with a Class that is inescapably large.&#160; Perhaps it is a web service that has been in use for a while by customers or other groups within your company, and you can&#8217;t just deprecate the service very easily; so you just keep extending it and adding more web methods to it for additional, similar functionality.&#160; Another potential situation could be that you began designing a simple application all in one file but it grew to be a little bigger than expected, but it doesn&#8217;t quite merit a whole major redesign into appropriate classes.&#160; I know how this all sounds, but these scenarios aren&#8217;t exactly uncommon in real-world practice, where there are other factors in consideration.&#160; I suppose many would resort to <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/9a1ybwek.aspx">C# <font face="Courier New">regions</font></a>, but I&#8217;m not a fan of them as it really only gives the illusion that your code file is better grouped and somehow shorter.</p> <span class='fullpost'> <p>So if you need some decent semblance of organization in a messy class file with little effort, the partial Class feature can come to your rescue.&#160; You can basically create a partial Class file for each grouping of code that you would probably be putting in a C# <font face="Courier New">region</font>.&#160; For instance, a relatively small Windows Form application could be broken up into the following sub-files (all partial Classes of the same <font face="Courier New">MainForm</font> class):</p>  <ul>   <li><strong>MainForm.cs</strong> = contains the constructor and a few rare global enumerations, properties, or sub-classes </li>    <li><strong>MainForm.UI.cs</strong> = contains the event handlers and other supporting methods that interact directly with the UI </li>    <li><strong>MainForm.Processing.cs</strong> = contains the application logic designed to be spun off in a separate worker thread in order to keep the UI thread from blocking while waiting </li>    <li><strong>MainForm.Designer.cs</strong> = the auto-generated UI file from the Windows Form designer </li> </ul>  <p>Obviously you should try to architect your code better from the get-go, but perhaps what you are looking at is legacy code you have inherited from previous developers and the deadline is fast approaching.&#160; There are reasonable circumstances I can think of (and have encountered) where this quick &amp; dirty organization lets you keep an ounce of sanity, so that you can keep moving forward.</p> </span>  </div>
